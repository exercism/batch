# About

Batch scripting is a scripting language used primarily for running commands in the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe).
It allows users to automate tasks, manage files, and control the system environment through a series of command-line instructions.

Although Batch scripting is straightforward, it can handle a wide range of tasks, from simple file operations to more complex automation processes.

Batch files have a `.bat` or `.cmd` extension and can be executed directly by the Windows command interpreter.

The flexibility of Batch scripting makes it a powerful tool for system administrators, developers, and power users who need to automate routine tasks or create custom command-line tools.
